[SECURITY MODEL]
----------------

1. Vulnerability Layer (Simulated):
   - SQL Injection: Intentionally unparameterized queries in vulnerable_app/app.py.
   - XSS: Unsanitized template rendering in search and comments.
   - Brute Force: Weak password policies and direct login endpoint.

2. Detection Layer (Security Gateway):
   - Signatures: Regex patterns for common SQLi and XSS payloads.
   - Rate Limiting: Login attempt tracking per IP in login_attempts table.
   - Real-time Logging: All suspicious payloads captured in attack_logs.

3. Protection Layer (Security Gateway):
   - WAF: Blocks malicious requests before they reach the vulnerable server.
   - IP Blocking: Automatic blocking of IPs reaching brute force thresholds.
   - Alerting: Visual dashboard for administrator overview.

4. Database Security (Hardened for Lab):
   - project_user: Password-based auth for easy remote setup.
   - Simplified Auth: Avoids complex plugin issues for stable demonstration.
